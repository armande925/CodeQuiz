Code Quiz Assigment

Create a quiz that satisfies the parameters of the project

::INTRO::

At the start of this project I was really challenged by the requirements. All of the storage and recall protocols were enough to make this difficult, but to have them interact with each other without conflict was the true test. As usual, the styling was my favorite. I can see my strength growing in this department. Having only been in UCBX for 8 weeks, I look forward to what I'll be able to accomplish when the course if over.

::ABOUT::

This assignment was turned in late due to the fact that I was confused by the weekly assignment numbers. The scheduling project was turned in a week early and this one was a week late. The task of learning to interact with attr and querySelector was still very difficult for me.

::THE CODE::

I can't profess to have complete command of all the functions utilized in this project. I had help from multiple collaborators on the js side. The end result was that I had to go back through all the code and attempt to understand each portion on my own. This was a great exercise. I feel like I learned so much from this assignment. I can see how things will get easier as the assignments progress. Adding the sound prompts and and jeopardy music was just my way of trying to make the game more interactive.

::COLLABORATORS::

My collaborators on this project were numerous. Actually the most developers I have worked with to date. I see this as the future of my career in this industry. The ability to share information and tactics in order to realize the best outcome on a project. My classmates (Mark M. and Mark Y.) were part of my study group that helped me lay the groundwork for this task. My tutor (Sangeetha K.) was crucial in helping me understand the structure of this project and what it entailed. To her credit, I think I learned as much as I could about the structure of code, even though I may not understand everyline of code itself. Last, but not least, my brother (Arnell). He runs coding academy on the east coast called CareerDevs (http://careerdevs.com/). He has a way of explaining things related to computers, in a way that is simple even in it's complexity.
